    <h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
    <p>Over the past few years, I’ve grown not just in skills but in heart. I’ve come to understand that social work and technology are not separate paths, but powerful partners. My journey has shown me that compassion and code can walk hand in hand — helping people, telling their stories, and building solutions that matter. From community centers to classrooms to tech spaces, I carry the same mission: to uplift, connect, and inspire. I’m not just learning to code, I’m learning how to use technology to serve people better. And that’s what excites me most.</p>

  <section id="journey">
    <h2>🚀 My Learning Journey</h2>
    <p>My roots are in community work empowering girls, supporting youth, and advocating for justice. But I always believed I could do more. That’s when I stepped into the world of tech.</p>
    <p>Joining SheCodes opened up a whole new world. I learned the basics of coding and started believing in my ability to create. Then came the Power Learn Project where I dove deeper into software engineering gaining real confidence to explore how websites, apps, and innovation can solve community problems.</p>
    <p>Each day I grow, not just in knowledge, but in purpose. I’ve come to love mixing creativity, design, and digital tools to share meaningful stories and ideas with the world. My journey is just beginning, and I’m loving every moment.</p>
